# Stay Focused App
Welcome to the app that can aid in keeping your goals and your life mission statement on the top of mind. 

## Goals
One powerful technique you can do is write down 101 goals that you want to achieve in your life. Reading them every day can help keep you focused and stay on the path towards your destination.

## Life Mission Statement
As Tony Robbins pointed out, writing down a life mission statement can help you get aligned with your actions. With a mission statement, you can have a clearer state of mind to make decisions on what actions and opportunities you want to take. Measuring if those actions and opportunities are aligned with your life mission.
